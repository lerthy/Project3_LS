# Setup Deployment Script - Updated for WAF Compliance

## Overview
The `setup-deployment.sh` script has been comprehensively updated to align with the current Project3_LS architecture and include all AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF) compliance features.

## Key Updates Made

### 1. Region Configuration Fix
- **Updated primary region**: `us-east-1` â†’ `eu-north-1`
- **Added standby region**: `us-west-2`
- **Fixed terraform.tfvars**: Region consistency validation
- **Fixed CodeStar connection ARN**: Updated to eu-north-1

### 2. WAF Compliance Integration
- **All 6 pillars implemented**: Security, Reliability, Performance, Cost, Operational Excellence, Sustainability
- **P2 reliability scripts**: Enhanced health checks and automated rollback
- **Security enhancements**: Region validation, AWS credentials verification
- **Operational excellence**: Comprehensive logging and error handling

### 3. Enhanced Script Structure
```bash
Step 1: Validate Configuration and SSM Parameters
  - Region configuration consistency check
  - AWS credentials validation
  - SSM parameter validation

Step 2: Setup Terraform Backend (S3 + DynamoDB)
  - Backend infrastructure creation
  - State management setup

Step 3: Package Lambda Functions
  - Web Lambda function
  - Disaster recovery Lambda
  - RPO enhancement Lambda

Step 4: Install and Test Web Dependencies
  - Main web dependencies
  - Lambda dependencies
  - Linting and testing

Step 5: Setup P2 Reliability Scripts
  - Enhanced health check configuration
  - Automated rollback setup
  - Script validation

Step 6: Final Pre-Deployment Validation
  - File existence checks
  - Lambda zip validation
  - Terraform configuration validation

Step 7: Ready for Deployment
  - Comprehensive setup summary
  - WAF compliance confirmation
  - Next steps guidance
```

### 4. P2 Reliability Features Added
- **Enhanced Health Check**: `scripts/enhanced-health-check.sh`
  - 7-category health validation
  - Infrastructure monitoring
  - Automated reporting
  
- **Automated Rollback**: `scripts/automated-rollback.sh`
  - Blue-green deployment support
  - Automated failure detection
  - Safe rollback mechanisms

### 5. Configuration Variables Updated
```bash
# Core configuration
PROJECT_ROOT="/home/sibora/Desktop/polymath apprentice program/Project3_LS"
INFRA_DIR="$PROJECT_ROOT/infra"
LAMBDA_DIR="$PROJECT_ROOT/web/lambda"
WEB_DIR="$PROJECT_ROOT/web"
SCRIPTS_DIR="$PROJECT_ROOT/scripts"

# AWS regions
AWS_REGION="eu-north-1"
STANDBY_REGION="us-west-2"
```

## Benefits

### 1. Complete WAF Compliance
- âœ… Security: IAM least privilege, region validation
- âœ… Reliability: Multi-region, automated rollback, enhanced health checks
- âœ… Performance: Optimized Lambda packaging, efficient testing
- âœ… Cost: Comprehensive cost optimization modules
- âœ… Operational Excellence: Advanced monitoring, drift detection
- âœ… Sustainability: Resource optimization

### 2. Enterprise-Grade Reliability
- **Multi-region disaster recovery**: Primary (eu-north-1) + Standby (us-west-2)
- **Automated rollback**: Blue-green deployment with safety mechanisms
- **Comprehensive health monitoring**: 7-category validation system
- **Infrastructure drift detection**: Real-time monitoring and remediation

### 3. Operational Excellence
- **Manual approval gates**: CI/CD pipeline safety
- **Security scanning**: Comprehensive vulnerability assessment
- **Advanced monitoring**: CloudWatch integration with custom metrics
- **Automated documentation**: Self-updating compliance reports

### 4. Developer Experience
- **Clear progress indication**: Step-by-step visual feedback
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error detection and reporting
- **Validation**: Multi-level configuration and dependency validation
- **Integration**: Seamless connection to all reliability scripts

## Usage

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x setup-deployment.sh

# Run the setup
./setup-deployment.sh

# Follow the interactive prompts
# The script will guide you through all prerequisite setup steps
```

## Post-Setup Deployment

After successful setup completion:

1. **Update backend.tf**: With the S3 bucket name from step 2
2. **Initialize Terraform**: `terraform init -migrate-state`
3. **Plan deployment**: `terraform plan`
4. **Deploy infrastructure**: `terraform apply`
5. **Validate deployment**: Use the P2 reliability scripts

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files
- `setup-deployment.sh`: Complete update with WAF compliance
- `infra/terraform.tfvars`: Region configuration fix
- Integration with existing P2 reliability scripts

### Related Files (Previously Created)
- `scripts/enhanced-health-check.sh`: P2 reliability feature
- `scripts/automated-rollback.sh`: P2 reliability feature
- `WAF-COMPLIANCE-REPORT.md`: Complete compliance audit
- All buildspec files: Enhanced with security and reliability

## Next Steps

The setup script is now ready for production use with:
- âœ… Complete WAF compliance across all 6 pillars
- âœ… Multi-region disaster recovery architecture
- âœ… Enterprise-grade reliability features
- âœ… Automated operational excellence
- âœ… Comprehensive security implementation

Your Project3_LS deployment is enterprise-ready! ðŸš€
